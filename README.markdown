# Code4Lib 2016
## lodash.js API Tour

The goal of the lodash.js koans is to orient you to the [lodash](https://lodash.com/) JavaScript library through
automated testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the
lodash.js library.

## Orientation

Navigate to the `code4lib_javascript_workshop` folder using a file browser, and
double click on `KoansRunnnerJS.html`.

Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is
recommended. More stack trace information shows up for javascript on these
browsers.

The first error will be in `koans/js/AboutExpects.js`. Fix the first test and
refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

## Running the Koans

After completing `koans/js/AboutExpects.js`, open `KoansRunnerLoDash.html` and `koans/lodash/AboutCollectionMethods.js` to begin the lodash.js API tour.
